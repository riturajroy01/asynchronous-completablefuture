r# Resilient Microservice Calls with Resilience4j and Spring Boot
ðŸ§ª How It Works

| Feature                        | Behavior                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@CircuitBreaker`              | Opens after a % of calls fail; prevents further calls temporarily |
| `@TimeLimiter`                 | Cancels calls taking too long                                     |
| `@Retry`                       | Automatically retries transient failures                          |
| `fallbackMethod`               | Returns a safe fallback response                                  |
| `@Async` + `CompletableFuture` | Makes calls concurrent and non-blocking                           |


ðŸ’¡ Example Failure Scenario

If order-service is down:

Circuit breaker opens after 3 failed calls.

Future completes with List.of() (empty list fallback).

Response still returns user info with no orders â€” no total failure.

| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tune thresholds per service                    | Different microservices have different SLAs                   |
| Use centralized config via Spring Cloud Config | So you can tune circuit breakers dynamically                  |
| Add metrics                                    | `resilience4j-micrometer` gives Prometheus/Grafana visibility |
| Avoid `.block()` if using WebFlux end-to-end   | Prefer fully reactive (`Mono.zip()`) version                  |
| Always include fallbacks                       | Prevent total failure cascades                                |

Notes, tips, and production considerations

Fully non-blocking: no .block() anywhere â€” this keeps threads small and scalable.

Resilience4j annotations (@CircuitBreaker, @Retry) support Mono/Flux return types when using the Spring Boot starter.

Timeout: Mono.timeout(Duration) provides the reactive Time Limiter behavior; use a fallback to return a graceful response.

Fallbacks: reactive fallback methods must return Mono<...> or Flux<...> and match the original method signature plus Throwable.

Metrics: add resilience4j-micrometer to export circuit-breaker metrics to Prometheus/Grafana.

Logging: replace System.err.println with a proper logger.

Bulkhead (optional): for reactive, consider SemaphoreBulkheadOperator from Resilience4j if you want to limit concurrent reactive calls.

Operator-level control: if you need advanced control, you can also apply CircuitBreakerOperator.of(circuitBreaker) and RetryOperator.of(retry) manually in the reactive pipeline rather than annotations.
